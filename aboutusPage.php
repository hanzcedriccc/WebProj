            &nbsp Plantita is your one-stop plant shop that delivers all kinds of plants, pots, accessories, tools, and furniture. We even 
            host community workshops and provide E-guide for those starting their plant journey. Unlike humans, plant don't need to be
            watered everyday. With that out of the way, we believe that the key to planting success is as simple as basic understanding
            on plant-care, and a good pair of hands!
